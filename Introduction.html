Hello, readers! &nbsp;Welcome to my personal blog, where I'll be covering topics ranging from interesting science-related images, to technology, to topics that I think need broader understanding.<br />
<br />
My name is Randy Sherwood, and I am a data scientist/analyst/statistician (depending on who you're talking to), with a Master's of Science in Mathematics, concentration in Applied Statistics, and a post-baccalaureate certificate in Applied Mathematics. &nbsp;Professionally, I develop mathematical models to predict behavior, I analyze data to identify actionable insights, and I test hypotheses that have a business impact. &nbsp;In my spare time, I play around with a microscope, dabble in astronomy, and enjoy finer things in life like cars and cats--you'll no doubt find content from all of these areas of my life, over time.<br />
<br />
With that said, welcome, and enjoy!<br />
<br />
<br />
Randy
